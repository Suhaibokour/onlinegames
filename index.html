				<p>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel
					to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign
					of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their
					own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero",
					who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items
					for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being
					the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>
